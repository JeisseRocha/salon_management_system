### Prerequisites

This API uses Serverless Framework.
In order to package your dependencies locally with `serverless-python-requirements`, you need to have `Python3.8` installed locally. You can create and activate a dedicated virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
python3.8 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

# Run application locally # 

In order to run locally, you will need to first install `werkzeug` dependency, as well as all other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. It is recommended to use a dedicated virtual environment for that purpose. You can install all needed dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
pip install werkzeug
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run command:

```bash
serverless wsgi serve
```


# Deploy application # 

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard, which includes advanced features such as CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

In order to deploy with dashboard, you need to first login with:

```
serverless login
```

install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying payment-management-dev-api to stage dev (us-east-1)
